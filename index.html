      I am a college journalist currently enrolled in Eastern Illinois University. I have been working for the Daily Eastern News since I transfered to the university my junior year. I have worked as a staff reporter and than as both the Administration and the Entertainment editor. I have covered faculty meeting, Board of Trustees and I write up to ten stories per week.</p> 
      <p>As the Entertainment Editor, I also covered concert events, art exhibitions, poetry readings, and I have also dabbled in opinion writing as well.</p>
      <p> When I became the News Editor in Spring 2016, I assumed a larger leadership position among the newsroom. I was in charge making sure every story was edited and turned in on time to be laid out on the page. I also had some final say in what stories should be cover and which were not newsworthy.</p>
